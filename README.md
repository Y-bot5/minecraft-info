# Minecraft Cool Information
## April 3rd, 2018 (1.2.13)
In this update \(Update Aquatic\), Mojang released **dev commands** to IOS \(Apple's operating system.\) including  
- /crash - crashes runner's game
- Three different commands that all stop time
- /tptosuitabletree - teleports you to tree you can break \(why?\)
- */filldrive* - fills the users PC to a certain amount of bytes left!
- Other commands are listed [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Developer_commands).

The next day they were removed.

### This is all info I have so far.
